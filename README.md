This is a single-sprint group project where we are testing the functionality of [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/), a website created specifically for practicing automation coding.
To do this we will create a test framework using Selinium for web testing functionality, and Cucumber for making declarative Gherkin-syntax test cases.

## Setup

To run the tests, you will need to download a Chrome driver with a corresponding license. To do this, first update Chrome to the most recent version, and then [download the zip folder relevant for your operating system from here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/). Extract the files from the folder and make sure that it contains `chromedriver.exe` and `LISENCE.chromedriver`, and move both files into "src/test/resources".
