This is a single-sprint group project where we are testing the functionality of [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/), a website created specifically for practicing automation coding.
To do this we will create a test framework using Selinium for web testing functionality, and Cucumber for making declarative Gherkin-syntax test cases.
