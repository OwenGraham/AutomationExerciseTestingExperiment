#Feature: Product filtering
#  Scenario: As a customer, I want to filter products by gender, product category, and brand, so that I only see products relevant to me
#    Given I am on the home page
#    When I click the WOMEN option in the categories menu
#    And I click the DRESS option in the dropdown menu that opens
#    Then I should be taken to the page for Women's dresses
